## About
- Created for the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, assignment due March 11th, 2019. This app is an html page listing a set of user-added trains, pulled from a database on Firebase. The page dynamically prints all the trains and updates in real time, allowing any user to add additional trains. Using moment.js, it calculates the local time and determines the arrival time of the next train, based on the train's travel frequency.

## License
- Unlicense.

## How to use this code
- Fill the input fields on the page on the github environment to test out the real time firebase functionality. Arrival times are updated on refresh, but additional trains added will appear dynamically.
